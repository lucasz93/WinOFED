Starting with winOFED 3.1, checked installers are available in the
Checked_Installers\ folder.
These 'checked' installers will install a 'checked' version of winOFED.
All modules (except SYSWOW64\ components) are built checked.
See the winOFED manual for the discussion of how to determine installed file version.
Take note of the mouse-point hovering over the explorer displayed filename; the
'(DEBUG)' tag will identify the version as being built checked (aka, debug).
