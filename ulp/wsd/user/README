TODO
====

- use pd_handle or pd, but be consistent.

- try to inline FindSocketContext and more.

- use more than one wqc with ib_poll_cq.

- I think WSPRecv can be called before the connection is
established. Therefore the check of the state of the socket is
incorrect.

- protect the socket state transition. Use a function to check for
valid transitions?

- finish to fillup ibsp_pnp.c to manage dynamic IP addresses.

- ib_cm_rep can be sent synchronously. Should solve the accept dilema.

- some error paths are leaking ressources, esp IBSPAccept

- socket_info_list is not protected

- it might be possible to not get a completion event when the event bit is not set -> optimization. Disable sollicitation bit in that case.

- duplicating listen socket is not implemented. Is that possible? Will the switch do it?

- replace listen.mutex by mutex?

- maybe create a pool of created qps to speedup connections? Or keep existing QPs in a pool after the are moved to RESET.

- is it a good idea to hold socket_info->mutex while calling CM?

- do something about socket_info->port->hca
