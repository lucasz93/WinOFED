These 'shared' OFED files (shared between Linux and Windows) are mirrored here for the convience
of Windows developers.

The 'offical' OFED source files are located in the OFED git repository.

The policy is 'no source file changes' in non-build files (.h & .c) are accepted here.
Any source file changes here will likely be overwritten when refreshed from the OFED git repository.

The plan here is to have a single Linux and Windows source.

If you require source file changes, push the changes to the OFED maintainers.

For continuing policy discussion, please contact sean.hefty@intel.com
