This document describes installation steps for developers and is
not end users.  The process described here is for developers running
on a homogeneous Windows HPC cluster.

Installation is divided into several phases in order to allow for
quick replacement of specific drivers and/or libraries.  Before
starting, the developer should note the following:

- OS version running on the cluster (2003, 2008)
- Processor architecture of the cluster (x86, x64, ia64)
- Whether they want to install checked or free versions of
  drivers and libraries.


1. Build the sources.

Refer to docs\built.txt and bldwo.bat for details on building the
source code.  As an example, this will build the sources to install
on a 2008 HPC cluster running on 64-bit processors.

	bldwo chk x32 2008
	bldwo fre x32 2008
	bldwo chk x64 2008
	bldwo fre x64 2008

You must build both the checked and free versions of the source to
use this installation process, and include 32-bit binaries when
installing on a 64-bit system.  This is because the inf files
reference 32-bit checked and free and 64-bit checked and free
versions of the libraries in the install process.
The correct version (checked or free) of the drivers and executables
will be installed.

Note: during development, you only need to rebuild the actual
version undergoing testing, as long as the other files are
available.  You may also build from a specific directory in
the source tree to only rebuild those files undergoing active
development.


2. Create packages.

Use etc\pkgwo.bat to sort the compiled source code into their
respective packages.  The separation of the source code into
packages allows quick rebuilding and replacement of selected
modules.  For example, the following creates packages for a
2008 HPC cluster.

	pkgwo fre x64 2008 all

This creates packages for all the various drivers under
install\2008\x64\fre (ibbus, ipoib, mlx4_bus, winverbs, etc.)


3. Deploy the packages to the head node.

Use etc\depwo.bat to copy the packaged files to the HPC cluster
head node for installation across the cluster.  The files are
copied into \winof\install on the head node.  For example, the
following deploys the packages to a head node named 'hpc-head'.

	depwo fre x64 2008 hpc-head


4. Add a test certificate.

NOTE: This step only needs to be done once.

As part of the package deployment, batch files were copied to the
head node.  Run \winof\install\addcert.bat on the head node to create
a test certificate (WinOFCert.cer) that can be used to test sign the
drivers.

	cd \winof\install
	addcert

To support test signed drivers, you may need to execute the following
command across the cluster.

	clusrun bcdedit -set testsigning on
	clusrun shutdown /r


5. Sign the drivers.

Run \winof\install\signall to create driver catalog files and sign
all drivers, libraries, and executables that were deployed to the
head node.

	cd \winof\install
	signall

You can limit signing to a specific package by changing into that
package's directory and running signwo.bat.


6. Install the packages.

You can install the packages by running dpinst in each package.  Packages
should be installed in the following order, depending on your HCA type:

	mlx4_bus -> mlx4_hca -> ipoib
	mthca -> ipoib

Note: The HCA drivers automatically install the ibbus, winverbs, and
winmad packages.  Separate installations of those packages are not
necessary.  The following provides an installation example:

	clusrun \\hpc-head\c$\winof\install\mlx4_bus\dpinst -f -q -c
	clusrun \\hpc-head\c$\winof\install\mlx4_hca\dpinst -f -q -c
	clusrun \\hpc-head\c$\winof\install\ipoib\dpinst -f -q -c
