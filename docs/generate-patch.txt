Patches can be generated using the 'svn diff' utility if the changes are
limited to a single branch in the svn tree.  However, to generate a patch
by comparing two branches using a 'diff' program (e.g. GnuWin32 'diff'),
the following syntax will help produce patches that are more easily
reviewable:

diff -up -r -X trunk\docs\dontdiff.txt -I \$Id: old_path new_path

For full diff syntax information, see the diff documentation, but as a summary:

-u  provides a unified diff (includes lines around changed lines for context)
 p  lists the C function name containing the diff
-r  does a recursive diff (use when old_path and new_path are directories)
-X  excludes files listed in docs\dontdiff from the diff
-I  ignores diffs caused by the SVN Id line

Patches generated using this method can be applied by using a 'patch' program,
such as GnuWin32 'patch'.
